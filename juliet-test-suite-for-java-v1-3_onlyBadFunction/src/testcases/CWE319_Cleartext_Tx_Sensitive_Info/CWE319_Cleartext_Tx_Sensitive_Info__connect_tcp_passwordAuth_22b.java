 * CWE: 319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
 * BadSource: connect_tcp Read password using an outbound tcp connection
 * GoodSource: Set password to a hardcoded value (one that was not sent over the network)

 *    BadSink : Use password directly in PasswordAuthentication()
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a public static variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.
