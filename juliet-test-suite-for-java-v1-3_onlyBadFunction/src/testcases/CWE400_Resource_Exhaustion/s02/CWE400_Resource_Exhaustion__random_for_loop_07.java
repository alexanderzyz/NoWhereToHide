* CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
* BadSource: random Set count to a random value
* GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
* Sinks: for_loop
*    GoodSink: Validate count before using it as the loop variant in a for loop
*    BadSink : Use count as the loop variant in a for loop
* Flow Variant: 07 Control flow: if(privateFive==5) and if(privateFive!=5)
