 * CWE: 129 Improper Validation of Array Index
 * BadSource: large_fixed Set data to a value greater than the size of the array
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: array_size
 *    GoodSink: data is used to set the size of the array and it must be greater than 0
 *    BadSink : data is used to set the size of the array, but it could be set to 0
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a public static variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.
