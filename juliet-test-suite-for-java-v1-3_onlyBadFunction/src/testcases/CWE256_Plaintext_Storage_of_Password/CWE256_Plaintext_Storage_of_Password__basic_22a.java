 * @description
 * CWE: 256 Plaintext Storage of a Password.  Read the password from a Properties file or a regular file.  In the good case, read the file from the console.
 * BadSource:  Read password from a .properties file (from the property named password)
 * GoodSource: Read password from a .properties file (from the property named password) and then decrypt it
 * Sinks:
 *    GoodSink: Decrypt password and use decrypted password as password to connect to DB
 *    BadSink : Use password as password to connect to DB
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a public static variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.
